# face-detection-with-FPGA-spartan6
This project implements a real-time face detection system on FPGA using a modified Viola-Jones algorithm integrated with a neural network for image enhancement. The system processes camera input in RGB565 format, detects faces using intensity and edge analysis, and outputs the processed image to an LCD display with detected faces highlighted in red.

 Developed by Athena Adampira, Mina Ebrahimi, Morteza Afroozeh, Athena Daneshi, Seyed Saeed Mortazavi, and Mobina Mirhosseinkhani.
